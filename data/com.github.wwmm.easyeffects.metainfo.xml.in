  <description>
    <p>EasyEffects is an advanced audio manipulation tool. It includes an equalizer, limiter, compressor and a reverberation tool, just to mention a few. To complement this there is also a built in spectrum analyzer.</p>
    <p>EasyEffects is the successor to PulseEffects. EasyEffects only supports PipeWire's audio server. PulseAudio users should instead use PulseEffects.</p>
    <p>Because EasyEffects uses the default PipeWire sound server it will work with most, if not all, applications you use. All supported applications are presented in the main window, where each can be enabled individually.</p>
    <p>Besides manipulating sound output, EasyEffects is able to apply effects to an input device, such as a microphone. This is, for example, useful in audio recording, but it also works well during voice conversations.</p>
    <p>When EasyEffects is launched it will conveniently remember the configuration used in the last session. It is also possible to save all the current settings as profiles.</p>

    <release type="stable" version="6.2.7" date="2022-07-18T00:00:00Z">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>Features:</li>
          <li>The bypass state can be saved to the preset file. The reasons why this was done can be seen at issue 1039</li>
          <li>The preset autoloading code compatibility with usb devices has been improved.</li>
          <li>A dialog is shown to the user when a preset fails to load or a preset/impulse file fails to be imported.</li>
          <li>The SideChain Gate plugin from `Linux Studio Plugins` is now used instead of the one from Calf Studio.</li>
          <li>Bug fixes:</li>
          <li>EasyEffects should not crash anymore when the user locale is not properly configured.</li>
          <li>A workaround was implemented in our icon to deal with the lack of proper SVG support in QT.</li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release type="stable" version="6.2.6" date="2022-06-22T00:00:00Z">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>Features:</li>
          <li>When effects are disable to an application we now set its target metadata to null. This will allow the media session manager (wireplumber) to properly move the stream to a new device.</li>
          <li>A new configuration option was added. It allows EasyEffects to ignore streams whose purpose is to monitor sink devices. This will help to fix some of problems our users were having when using OBS.</li>
          <li>The code that shows the stream sample format has been improved</li>
          <li>The rnnoise library is now optional. This should help package maintainers to build a Debian package. See issue 1000 for more information.</li>
          <li>Our logs now show the source code line where the messages are being printed</li>
          <li>Bug fixes:</li>
          <li>The "enable effects" checkbox in our window was not being updated when third party programs like pavucontrol moved the stream away from our virtual devices. This should be fixed now.</li>
          <li>Fixed a crash that could happen when the maximum autogain history was changed.</li>
          <li>Avoid crashes when pw-mididump is running</li>
        </ul>
      </description>

    <release type="stable" version="6.2.5" date="2022-04-30T00:00:00Z">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>Features:</li>
          <li>The interface of the pitch plugin was improved</li>
          <li>Our application icon is now compatible with desktops that uses QT</li>
          <li>Our blocklist code will use the `application.id` tag if the stream sets it</li>
          <li>In order to avoid problems with the mouse scroll the entries in the applications list shown in our `Players/Recorders` tab do not show a volume scale anymore. More details about the problem and the solution for it can be found on issue 1211 and issue 1427</li>
          <li>When no application is available for display in the `Players/Recorders` a message will be shown to the user</li>
          <li>Many translation updates</li>
          <li>Bug fixes:</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where EasyEffeects crashed when the number of points displayed in the spectrum was changed while our pipeline was active and the spectrum widget was visible</li>
          <li>The pipeline latency value displayed in our window could be wrong in some situations. This was fixed.</li>
        </ul>

    </release>
    <release type="stable" version="6.2.4" date="2022-03-07T00:00:00Z">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>Features:</li>
          <li>There is a new setting allowing the user to select an inactivity timeout for the pipeline. When no client is playing to or recording from our devices the filters will be unlinked after the timeout is reached. This is done to make sure we do not waste CPU power processing silence.</li>
          <li>The autogain plugin now allows the user to select which of the three loudness are used to calculate the geometric mean.</li>
          <li>The autogain plugin now allows the maximum history to be set and does not use `libebur128` histogram mode anymore. This should avoid the cases where the `Integrated` loudness gets stuck forever in the same value.</li>
          <li>EasyEffects icon has been updated in a way that should make it visible in QT desktops.</li>
          <li>Bug fixes:</li>
          <li>The command line option that returns the global bypass state is working again.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Features:</li>
          <li>The crossfeed filter should deal better with PipeWire's dynamic latency switches. Jumps in volume level should not happen anymore in these situations.</li>
          <li>Bug fixes:</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug that prevented mono microphones from properly working with EasyEffects</li>

          <li>Support for the next PipeWire release `0.3.44`</li>
          <li>The autogain filter should deal better with PipeWire's dynamic latency switches. Jumps in volume level should not happen anymore in these situations.</li>
          <li>We added an option that allows the volume and mute state of our virtual devices to be reset when EasyEffects starts. It should help with the cases were our devices are muted by the audio server for unknown reasons.</li>
          <li>Better support for computer suspending.</li>
          <li>Updated translations</li>
          <li>Bug fixes:</li>

          <li>Features:</li>
          <li>Improved equalizer interface.</li>
          <li>Now we use a sidechain LSP compressor that allows the user to select and external source as the sidechain input.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Features:</li>
          <li>This is one of the biggest releases that I have ever made. The amount of changes is so big that it is hard to talk about everything here.</li>
          <li>The following are just the most import ones. People interested on the journey that got us here can take a look at issue 904 and issue 874.</li>
          <li>The application and its repository have been renamed from PulseEffects to `EasyEffects`</li>
          <li>gtkmm3 was replaced by gtkmm4</li>
          <li>Gstreamer was replaced by native PipeWire filters.</li>
          <li>Many features were reimplemented from scratch. The preset autoloading is one example. Another remarkable change will be seen in the plugins selection menu. Now the user can show in the window only the plugins that he/she wants to use.</li>
          <li>Boost is no longer a dependency. The price paid for that was a little change in our presets structures. With some patience it is possible to edit PulseEffects presets in a text editor and make them work in EasyEffects. Hopefully someone will come up with a script for this in the feature.</li>
          <li>New libraries are being used and some of the librarires that were optional before are now required</li>
